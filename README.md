# Data Science, Machine Learning, and Python Portfolio
This repository contains Data Analytics and Machine Learning work implemented using Python.

## Data Analyzation and visualization using Python's Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries

Exploited the power of Python's Pandas library and did analyzation of three datasets namely Salaries.csv, Ecommerce Purchases.csv, and 911 Calls.csv.
